# Learning Kotlin

## Important Notes  
- Kotlin can infer variable type, don't need to specify type when assigning the value
- `val` = value, immutable
- trying to assign `kotlin.Int` to java `Integer` and does not work
    - why was this decision made?
- Kotlin does not allow you to use un-initialized values
- Don't need the `new` keyword to instantiate objects
