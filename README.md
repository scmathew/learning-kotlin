# Learning Kotlin

## Notes  
- Kotlin can infer variable type, don't need to specify type when assigning the value
- `val` = value, immutable
- trying to assign `kotlin.Int` to java `Integer` and does not work
    - why was this decision made?
- Kotlin does not allow you to use un-initialized var/val
- Don't need the `new` keyword to instantiate objects
- Kotlin has "smart casting" when an explicit type check `is` done
  - if you do need to cast manually use the `as` keyword
